> We all know what we should be doing to help better our environment, that doesn't mean we all know how.

## The Problem

Hundreds of millions of people order products online each year, this is a huge factor in the use of our Natural Resources. We are told to be more **Eco-Aware** and **Eco-Friendly** in our day-to-day life but not really told how. We all know what we **should** be doing to help better our environment, that doesn't mean we all know **how**. It can be a struggle when trying to adjust your lifestyle to help save our planet's Ecosystem.

This may be the Root Cause to Problems such as:

* The rise of **Global Pollution** due to Delivery Distances
* Products being bought online when **Local Businesses** may supply the same
* Complicated energy information preventing more **Energy Efficient** products being used

## Our Solution

MyTerra's aim is to make saving our environment an easier and more enjoyable experience. MyTerra suggests more Eco-friendly products online by recommending more energy efficient products or even by providing a more local choice. Shopping locally can not only just help your fellow neighbours business but also help save our planet's natural resources.
