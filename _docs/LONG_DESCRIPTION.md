## The Problem

> We all know what we should be doing to help better our environment, that doesn't mean we all know how.

Hundreds of millions of people order products online each year, this is a huge factor in the use of our **Natural Resources**.

We all know what we **should** be doing to help better our environment, that doesn't mean we all know **how**. It can be a struggle when trying to adjust your lifestyle to help save our planet's Ecosystem.

Problems Caused by this:

* The rise of **Global Pollution** due to Delivery Distances
* Products being bought online when **Local Businesses** may have similar or better alternatives
* Confusing energy information preventing more **Energy Efficient** products being used

## The Solution

> MyTerra's aim is to make saving our environment an easier and more enjoyable experience.

Using **IBM Cloud Services**, the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/energy-climate-change-environment/standards-tools-and-labels/products-labelling-rules-and-requirements/energy-label-and-ecodesign/product-database_en">EPREL DB</a> and **IBM's CI/CD Pipelines**. We have designed a cross-platform application using **Google's Flutter Framework** that suggests more Eco-friendly products when shopping online, providing more local alternatives and Eco-awareness encouragement.

> Shopping locally can not only just help your fellow neighbours business but also help save our planet's natural resources.

The aim is to:

* Create a simple way of reading **Product Energy Information** and compare this information with other **Products** 
* Help reduce the use of our **Natural Resources** by suggesting **Eco-alternative** methods
* Compare and suggest **Eco-alternative** products online
* Create a social **Network** of people who are passionate about doing their part to clean the **Environment**
* Show users how **damaging** to our planet one choice can be vs a more **Eco-alternative choice**
* Encourage Eco-awareness through the use of **leaderboards** and **scores** to show off your impact on saving our Planet!
