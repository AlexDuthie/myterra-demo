## The Problem

> We all know what we should be doing to help better our environment, that doesn't mean we all know how.

Hundreds of millions of people order products online each year, this is a huge factor in the use of our **Natural Resources**.

We all know what we **should** be doing to help better our environment, that doesn't mean we all know **how**. It can be a struggle when trying to adjust your lifestyle to help save our planet's Ecosystem.

Problems Caused by this:

* The rise of **Global Pollution** due to long **Delivery Distances**
* Products being bought online when **Local Businesses** may have similar or better alternatives
* Confusing energy information preventing more **Energy Efficient** products being used

## The Solution

> MyTerra's aim is to make saving our environment an easier and more enjoyable experience.

Using **IBM Cloud Services**, the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/energy-climate-change-environment/standards-tools-and-labels/products-labelling-rules-and-requirements/energy-label-and-ecodesign/product-database_en">EPREL DB</a> and **IBM's CI/CD Pipelines**. We have designed a cross-platform application using **Google's Flutter Framework** that suggests more Eco-friendly products when shopping online, providing more local alternatives and Eco-awareness encouragement.

> Shopping locally can not only just help your fellow neighbours business but also help save our planet's natural resources.

The aim is to:

* Create a simple way of reading **Product Energy Information** and compare this information with other **Products** 
* Help reduce the use of our **Natural Resources** by suggesting **Eco-alternative** methods
* Compare and suggest **Eco-alternative** products online
* Create a social **Network** of people who are passionate about doing their part to clean the **Environment**
* Show users how **damaging** to our planet one choice can be vs a more **Eco-alternative choice**
* Encourage Eco-awareness through the use of **leaderboards** and **scores** to show off your impact on saving our Planet!

## How It Works

In collaboration with **Google's Flutter Framework**, **EPREL** and countless **IBM Cloud Services**. We can deploy a cross-platform application that could in time:

* Compare products via their energy consumption rates
    * **IBM Watson** could be used to determine delivery distance, energy consumption etc.
    * Energy data would be provided by the **EPREL** database and possibly stored inside an **IBM Db2** instance
* Have continuous development with **IBM's CI/CD Delivery Pipelines**
* Allow users to gain **TerraPoints** to rank up on our **Eco-Board** to display how energy efficient and Eco-aware they have been while using **MyTerra**
* **Educate** users with articles and videos on our **Planet's** current **Ecosystem** which would also provide **TerraPoints**

> Saving the planet is going to take a lot of work, so why not have fun while you do it!

### Scalability

**Google's Flutter** allows us to deploy our application to **Android**, **Windows** and **iOS** in 1/2 the development time. MyTerra's comparison system could also be used within a browser extension too by comparing products when browsing online.

### Main Goal

The main goal is to simplify the understanding of energy consumption rates AND to encourage Eco-awareness by making it **fun**.

**EPREL** is going to be a huge database that stores energy consumption rates from products all across Europe. We believe that we could achieve a similar approach by using **IBM's Db2** and other **IBM services**. The same data could be stored in time, but on a larger scale.
