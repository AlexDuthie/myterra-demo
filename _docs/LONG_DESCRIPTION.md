> We all know what we should be doing to help better our environment, that doesn't mean we all know how.

## The Problem

Hundreds of millions of people order products online each year, this is a huge factor in the use of our <u>Natural Resources</u>. We are told to be more **Eco-Aware** and **Eco-Friendly** in our day-to-day life but not specifically told how. Understanding the impact of your choices when ordering online can be a hard task, reading energy information charts can be confusing and sometimes the information you would need might not even exist.

Points to Consider with Mass Online Shopping:

* The rise of **Global Pollution** due to Delivery Distances
* Products being bought online when **Local Businesses** may supply the same
* Complicated energy information preventing more **Energy Efficient** products being used
